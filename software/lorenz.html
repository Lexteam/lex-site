            Lorenz is a library built for Java, to allow for interaction with JVM de-obfuscation mappings. It is designed to be modular, so for
            example developers can implement parsers and writers for their own mapping formats. <i>Lorenz currently only supports SRG.</i>

            Lorenz is no longer a Lexteam project, although the documentation and site will remain on the Lexteam site for the foreseeable future.
