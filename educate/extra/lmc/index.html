    <h2 class="subtitle">Example (basic_calc)</h2>

    <p>Using the knowledge you've gained above, you should be able to build a simple calculator program like the one below:</p>

    <pre class="assembler">
    INP    # Waits for input and stores it in the accumulator
    STA 99 # Stores the contents of the accumulator to the memory address: 99
    INP    # Waits for input and stores it in the accumulator
    ADD 99 # Add the contents of memory address: 99 to the accumulator
    OUT    # Outputs the contents of the accumulator
    HLT    # Signify the end of the program
    </pre>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Labels</h2>

    <p>
        In larger programs, you may be storing lots of data, so using raw memory locations all over the place probably isn't the best of ideas. Labels
        solve this problem, and make you code neater at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Labels represents a memory address, and can be defined anywhere in your program.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Representing an instruction (labels_basic)</h2>

    <p>
        Here we are using a label to represent the memory location of an instruction.
    </p>

    <pre class="assembler">
START INP    # Waits for input and stores it in the accumulator
      STA 99 # Stores the contents of the accumulator to the memory address: 99
      INP    # Waits for input and stores it in the accumulator
      ADD 99 # Add the contents of memory address: 99 to the accumulator
      OUT    # Outputs the contents of the accumulator
      HLT    # Signify the end of the program
    </pre>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Representing a memory location for data (labels_advanced)</h2>

    <p>
        Here we are using a label to represent the memory location of data.
    </p>

    <pre class="assembler">
START INP     # Waits for input and stores it in the accumulator
      STA NUM # Stores the contents of the accumulator to the memory address of the label: NUM
      INP     # Waits for input and stores it in the accumulator
      ADD NUM # Add the contents of memory address of the label: NUM to the accumulator
      OUT     # Outputs the contents of the accumulator
      HLT     # Signify the end of the program
NUM   DAT 1   # Defines the label: NUM as containing data, and sets it to a preset of 1
    </pre>
