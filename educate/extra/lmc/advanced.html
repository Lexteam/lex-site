    <p>Branching is the process of executing a different sequence of instructions.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Branching Instructions</h2>

    <p>The following are instructions relevant to branching.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>

    <p>
        Continuing with the trend of a calculator, let's build a dual-purpose calculator using the skills learnt so far.

    <pre class="assembler">
START    INP          # Waits for input and stores it in the accumulator
         STA MODE     # Stores the contents of the accumulator into the memory location of the label: MODE
