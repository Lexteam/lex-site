What is now a couple weeks ago, we had a chat about how we'd like to proceed with PastPapers and although I'm 
reluctant to reveal everything in this blog post I would like to talk about why we decided to review what we were doing.

Every team be it big or small doesn't do things for the sake of it or because it follows 'the plan'. Despite having 
what you think is a rock-solid plan, things may fall through, you might start to see that 'the plan' wasn't as good as 
you'd originally thought. Often this may fall into making the best piece of software, following your own set of 
limitations, not making a different project because of limitations of a third-party.

In PastPapers case setting limitations based on that of third-parties was something that was getting increasingly 
regular, not to mention the painful and sub-par method we had for storing and indexing papers. We all had ideas that 
were immediately dismissed because of these limitations. Well we'd had enough of that and as such have started to 
build our own process, that will be discussed further in depth when we have a better idea ourselves on exactly how it 
would work internally.

The basic idea still follows from having an application where students can revise. However we plan to both extend and 
improve that functionality. Stay tuned for more information.
