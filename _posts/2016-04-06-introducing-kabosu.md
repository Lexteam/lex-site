Kabosu is a up and coming build server built with Golang. It is designed to be simple, concise and lightweight.

For Kabosu's initial release we plan to have a basic GUI, alongside webhook support for GitHub, GitLab and Gogs, and 
a basic build executor.

The current build executor is based around a simple ini file: ```kabosu.ini```, which defines all the build stages 
you may have. I plan to document this file, before the initial release.

The source is currently available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lexteam/Kabosu).
