Once again we are releasing another Violet release and seemingly taking longer between versions.

Violet 1.2 was a big release for us as we decided to rip Violet apart and build a completely different look.
However we are still a long way off being as much of a modular framework as the likes of Bootstrap.

Many changes were made in this release, all of which you can find on our [changelog](/software/violet/changelog/) page.
