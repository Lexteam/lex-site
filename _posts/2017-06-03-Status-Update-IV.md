title: Status Update IV

So this has been a few months in the making...

To be quite frank, very little has been going on with Lexteam, we've all been rather
busy and still remain to be, and Lexteam has kinda been shoved under the carpet.

## Educate

Late last year, I started producing a number of revision notes for students doing the
new Computer Science GCSE. Over time I started to realise that the work I was doing
was very similar to the work Ethan was doing with PastPapers, in that they are both
aimed at helping students study. From this, [Lexteam Educate] was born. Very little has
been done to Lexteam Educate since the transition, this is because there is currently
no tooling to easily write documentation. Rest assured that I am working towards this
goal, and it ties in very heavily with my plans for out website.

## Website

On that note, lets talk about the website. Despite the odd commit, and Lexteam Educate,
very little has been going on. However, that is not to say there are not plans... I
plan to start to take apart the site and make it easier to maintain. To do this, I am
going to move Lexteam Educate, the documentation, and the archives to separate
projects. In the case of Educate and the documentation I will begin to use mkdocs for
them, making it easier to maintain with Violet and easier to write for. For the
archives, a separate solution using [Choo] will be used.

## Violet

Despite the 1.2.1 release earlier in the year, very little work has been done on
Violet. Again this is not to say there are'nt plans, however there are not as big or
drastic plans as their is for lex-site. Essentially I am gearing up for a 1.3 release
with changes pertaining to *better mobile support*, *improved footer*, and a number
of other improvements such as proper table support that was implemented a short while
ago.

## PastPapers

Since I mentioned it earlier in the post, and it has'nt been talked about on this
blog in over a year, I though I should make a mention that yes **it is still a thing**
and no I do not have any news to share ;) Perhaps when there is some big news to
share regarding it, it will merit its own post by myself or Ethan.

I said in the last status update, that perhaps these would become a regular thing.
However these can only be as regular as there is news to share, and there has'nt been
much news recently. So this time I would like to leave on the note that perhaps if
development ramps up, there will be a status update quicker than the last.
