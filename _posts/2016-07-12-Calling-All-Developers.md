Hello! We're the developers behind an event you may have heard of called BlockJam. BlockJam is essentially a 48-hour-long semi-annual
event held to raise money for [Child's Play](http://childsplaycharity.org/), a charity which seeks to improve the lives of children in hospitals and
domestic violence shelters. Participants purchase tickets ahead of time and have access to our server network for the duration of the event. Proceeds
from tickets sold go directly to the charity.

One of the most important facets of our event is the selection of custom minigames we offer to participants. These games are designed to make the
event fun and enticing both for players and livestream viewers to help us raise as much money now and in future events as possible.

However, we're currently a bit short on manpower and are in need of additional developers to help us prepare the software in time for the event
later this year. If you have experience with Sponge/Java/programming and can dedicate some time to the project, we'd love to have you on board.
Just fill out [this brief application](http://goo.gl/forms/zgwTTWxf8hWyeg3g1) and we'll review it starting the week of July 18th and get back to you
ASAP.

For more detailed information about the event itself, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fnAI1l7KA0) from last year's event.
