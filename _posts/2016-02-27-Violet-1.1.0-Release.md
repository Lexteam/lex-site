Violet has been a project we have been working on for quite some time now, and we have finally made our first serious
 release: 1.1.0
 
Alongside this release we have made our CLI tool for installing Violet, which you can read about on our [documentation
 page](/violet/) which also came about with the 1.1.0 release.
 
Over our next few releases we plan to revamp Violet, and turn it into a CSS framework, that not only works for our
 website. So feel free to post as many issue as you like on our 
 [GitHub](https://github.com/Lexteam/lexteam.github.io/issues) on what you want.
