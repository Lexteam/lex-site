- Allow for more customisation of the nav bar
- Removed some none-Violet related classes (this is potentially breaking, and if you are using violet, our apologies)
- More variables to customise Violet with (we are working towards more customisation than just colours)
- New page related classes (.content)
- Style blockquotes
